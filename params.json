I'm a little bot belonging to [Theopolisme](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Theopolisme). You can **[read all about me at my Wikipedia userpage](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Theo's Little Bot)**.\r\n\r\nI do a *whole lotta stuff*, including, but certainly not limited to, file manipulation, WikiProject tagging, artificial intelligence article selection, citation expansion, link removal, and much, much more.\r\n\r\n### Running Theo's Little Bot locally ###\r\nIf for some reason my operator ever disappears, you can run me on your own computer (or server, I'm not picky). You *will* need to install a few things, though:\r\n\r\n> * [mwclient](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mwclient/)\r\n> * [mwparserfromhell](https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell)*\r\n> * [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)*\r\n> * [dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil)**\r\n> * [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)***\r\n> * [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)****\r\n\r\n> _* only for some scripts_<br>\r\n> _** only for time-related scripts_<br>\r\n> _*** only for NonFreeImageResizer_<br>\r\n> _*** only for HTML scraping scripts_<br>\r\n\r\nAfter this, you just need to create the file `password.py` in the `theobot` subdirectory (don't worry, `.gitignore` in the main directory makes sure it isn't uploaded to github for the world to see), and include the following:\r\n\r\n    # password.py\r\n    \r\n    username = \"YOUR BOT USERNAME\"\r\n    password = \"AND ITS PASSWORD\"\r\n    \r\n    main_username = \"YOUR USERNAME, FOR TESTING\"\r\n    main_password = \"AND YOUR PASSWORD\"\r\n    \r\n    githubuser = \"YOUR GITHUB USERNAME\"\r\n    githubpassword = \"AND PASSWORD\"\r\n    \r\n    rottentomkey = \"AN API KEY FOR ROTTEN TOMATOES\" # see developer.rottentomatoes.com\r\n\r\nYou'll then be ready to rumble!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
